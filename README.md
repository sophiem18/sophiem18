# 👋🏼 Hi Everyone, I am Sophie Mettille🧚🏼‍♀️

### A little bit about me...
<ul>
  <li>I just graduated with a BS in Computer Science at Temple University🦉🍒👩🏻‍🎓</li>
  <li>I want to persue a career in software development, product management, or UI/UX Design specifically on the developing end with user-focused frontend dev</li>
  <li>In my freetime I love drawing, painting, running, and listening to new music🎶</li>
  
</ul>

### Take a look around. 
My page mainly contains my school projects. I am working on my portfolio - I want it to be perfect and really reflect who I am as a designer and developer.
